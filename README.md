Dijkstra algorithm in ruby

This is a simple code that finds the shortest path in a maze using Dijkstra's Algorithm for training purposes.

# Installation
Install ruby 3.1.1 and bundler. Then run:
```
bundle install
```

# Testing
```
bundle exec rspec
```

# Future changes
As a future change I'd like to try to go for an OOP approach.
